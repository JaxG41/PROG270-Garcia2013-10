An El Paso, Texas favorite
--------------------------

~~~~
Frozen beef taquitos (fry until crisp in oil 2-3 minutes)
large bag finely shredded cheese (mexican mix good)
One large can whole tomatoes
4-5 jalapenos (cut off stems, I leave seeds)
2 cubes tomatoe base boullion and 2 cubes chicken boullion
1 gallon water
salt to taste ( should need almost none b/c of boullion cubes)
~~~~

Boil can tomatoes with cubes in gallon of water until rolling boil for about 15 minutes.
Remove tomatoes only and blend on liquify in blender, return to pot of soup
Take fresh jalapenos and blend on liquify with a small amount of water. (you should see only very minute pieces)
Add jalapenos to soup. Remove from stove. Store in plastic containers.Can freeze some of this.

Deep fry beef taquitos until crisp about 2-3 minutes. Place in a bowl that has about a cup of hot soup, cover taquitos with cheese.

For their green jalapeno sauce,

~~~~
8 fresh jalapenos
4-5 tomatillas
lime juice, salt
~~~~

Boil whole tomatillos with cut up jalapenos ( leave seeds) in enough water to cover them and boil until soft. Pour off excess water, blend tomatillas and jalapenos on liquify until it is a smooth sauce. Add a couple tablespoons of lime juice and a little salt. If you want it really hot, Add some serrano chilis to this for increased heat.

Enjoy!
